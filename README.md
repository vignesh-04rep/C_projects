📘 C Projects Repository
This repository contains a curated set of C language programs designed to strengthen core programming concepts and problem-solving skills. Each project focuses on foundational topics such as pointers, memory management, structures, file handling, and algorithmic logic. These implementations are built with clarity and efficiency in mind, making them ideal for students and developers preparing for technical interviews, coding rounds, or academic mastery. The code is written in standard C and emphasizes clean syntax, modular design, and practical use cases.

🔧 Projects Included
Pointer_Operations.c: Demonstrates pointer arithmetic and memory access.

Struct_Manipulation.c: Explores nested structures and data organization.

File_IO.c: Reads and writes structured data using file handling.

(Add more as you expand — e.g., Sorting algorithms, Matrix operations, etc.)
